Sliding Block Puzzle Solver
This project implements a solver for sliding block puzzles of sizes 2x2 and 3x3. It provides solutions using two different algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) for both sizes and a brute-force method specifically for the 2x2 size.

How to Use
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation
No installation steps are required. Simply clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

Usage
Open the bruteforce2x2_and_3x3_BFS.ipynb notebook in a Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Execute the cells to run the solvers for both the 2x2 and 3x3 sliding block puzzles.
Follow the example usage provided in the notebook to input initial puzzle states and observe the solutions.
